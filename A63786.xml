            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Secondly, that no Magi≈øtrate ≈øhould have power over their bodies, neither ≈øhould any one kill them by violence.

≈øhould be ≈øo, but time that manife≈øts all truthes, hath clearly evidenced to the world their falla≈øies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I need not to make any larger de≈øcription of them, ≈øeeing they are long ≈øince dead by the plague, when they were both pri≈øoners, which was the ju≈øt Judgment of God upon them for their ba≈øe deceivable qualities.

            <p>The ≈øecond two pretended Prophets, is <hi>John Robbins;</hi> and <hi>Jo≈øeph Garment,</hi> who are both yet alive; who did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that they were God, and had power to rai≈øe the dead: and ≈øecondly, by the clapping of their hands, they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ≈øtrike with death whom≈øoever they plea≈øed; and thirdly, that they were to be the Jews deliverers; fourthly, that they were able to divide the waters; fiftly, that they ≈øhould go to <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> with above a hundred thou≈øand people, whom they ≈øhould convoy thither, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rediculous and hereticall tenets, not worthy the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning; and therefore I conclude, and go on to the next.</p>

To all which, they thus, or to the like effect an≈øwered.</p>
               <p>To the fir≈øt, that God had an audible voice, and that he was in the per≈øon of a man from al eternity, and that there was not, is not, nor never ≈øhall be any other God but the ≈øame Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, which was born of the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and ≈øuffered at <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> and that the world and all things el≈øe, was only, and alonely made by him, and that when this Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt was incarnate, and in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, and at his ≈øufferings, and in the grave, then there was no God in heaven, nor in earth, the government of all things for that time being committed to <hi>Moy≈øes</hi> and <hi>Elias;</hi> and what≈øoever God ≈øhould be profe≈ø≈øed by any, they had power, both to cur≈øe, and to damne them and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øours.</p>
               <p>To the ≈øecond, they plainly declared that they could not erre nor faile, and were both alike minded, for they had an infallible ≈øpirit, by the which they were able to di≈øcern all things: neither could any man deceive them, neither could any ≈øickne≈øs or any di≈øea≈øe ≈øeize upon their bodies, neither ≈øhould they ever commit any ≈øinne, neither at their death ≈øhould they have the like fear and trouble in the lea≈øt, as the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt had when he ≈øuffered.</p>
               <p>To the third they an≈øwered, that <hi>Moy≈øes,</hi> the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apo≈øtles had never the like light given them, nor the like power in ≈øpirituall things as they had, they being under the third and la≈øt di≈øpen≈øation; as they terme it, the di≈øpen≈øation of the ≈øpirit, therefore able to write Scriptures more then they al, and that there hath not been any man the≈øe fourteen hundred years pa≈øt, that ever hath ≈øpoken truth, from or truely opened any text of ≈øcripture, till they received their Comi≈ø≈øion.</p>
               <p>To all which, I thus reply:</p>
               <p>I do believe and declare unto the whole world, that that eternall, everliving, and all ≈øufficient, only wi≈øe God, who had his being of him≈øelfe, and in him≈øelfe, ≈øending forth all things, as of, ≈øo from, him≈øelfe; and againe retracting or drawing all things into him≈øelfe againe, is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35169:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
known, or declared to be what he is in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall or E≈ø≈øentiall being; for how can the Mortall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare or make manife≈øt the Immortall; the Creature the Creator; for the pot at furthe≈øt onely manife≈øts that it is made, but doth not know his Maker, neither can it ≈øo much as know his voyce; Then how can mortall man know the voyce of the Immortall God, which makes the Rocks to rend in pieces? Ye how terrible was the voyce of God to the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> that they never de≈øired to hear it any more, wherefore they de≈øired that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> might ≈øpeak with them, and not God any more?</p>
               <p>And ≈øecondly, whereas they do declare, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ≈øin at all, nor erre at any time, nor fail in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; I my ≈øelf with many others can witne≈ø≈øe ≈øeverall pa≈ø≈øages to the contrary, and let all rea≈øonable men judge if ra≈øh anger, ra≈øh judgement, cen≈øuring and back-biting be not ≈øinne: Again, I with many others is able to te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie again≈øt them to their faces, how they have failed and erred in judgement; for whereas they both affirmed that they were both endued, lighted, and guided by one and the ≈øelf-≈øame infallible ≈øpirit, that no man was able to deceive them, or go about it, but they ≈øhould be able to de≈øcern their hypocri≈øie or deceit.</p>
               <p>They having in my hearing, and in the hearing of ≈øome others pronounced the ≈øentence of Damnation upon a man; I asked whether or no this ≈øentence could not be revok'd upon the parties humiliation and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Errour; the one of them, to wit, <hi>Muggleton,</hi> an≈øwered it might; then I asked the other, to wit, <hi>Reeve,</hi> the ≈øame que≈øtion, and he an≈øwered and ≈øaid, It could not; by meanes whereof they did contend one again≈øt another, which ≈øhews they were of a different judgement: Again, the ≈øaid pretended Prophet <hi>Reeve</hi> having in my ≈øight with a many others pronounced the ≈øentence of ble≈ø≈øedne≈øs and ≈øalvation to a Gun≈ømith in the <hi>Minories,</hi> his fellow Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did within a quarter of an hour pronounce the ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of damnation upon the ≈øame party, and al≈øo the bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting of his E≈øtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:35169:6"/>
Again, not long ≈øince being in company with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid two pretended Prophets, and ≈øome other company, there came in a Gentleman whom they had damned three months before, or thereabouts; but the ≈øaid Gentleman not taking notice that ever he had ≈øeen them before, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying him≈øelf very fairly and ≈øeemingly, did approve of their judgements, by which meanes he did obtain their good liking, in≈øomuch that they both declared they had nothing again≈øt him, but that he might have the Ble≈ø≈øing, whereupon the Gentleman called them a couple of Loger-heads, ≈øaying, Are you the Prophets of the Lord, &amp; doth not know that ye have already ≈øentenced me to damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by all which (good people) ye may ≈øee their gro≈øs fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and that they may be ≈øubject to ≈øin, errour, and mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, notwith≈øtanding their great boa≈øting, that if any ≈øhould come into their company whom before they had cur≈øed, they ≈øhould di≈øcern and know him, although he ≈øhould never ≈øo much di≈øgui≈øe him≈øelf.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, the≈øe two pretended Prophets do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a≈ø≈øume unto them≈øelves a Prerogative and power above and beyond <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> &amp; the other Prophets and Apo≈øtles in the knowledge of the mind and wil of God in the Scriptures, but al≈øo that they can both adde to the≈øe Scriptures, and dimini≈øh from them, ≈øaying, What≈øoever they ≈øhall not approve of to be Scripture, is no Scripture at all, and ≈øo hath cut off all <hi>Salomons</hi> Writings, and the Book of <hi>Job</hi> to be any part of the Scripture, by means whereof there is a great ≈øtumbling block laid before the weak, who in the ≈øincerity of their hearts are ≈øeeking the Lord, and hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the≈øe Books in e≈øteem, as all other Scripture; nay; and ≈øome have ≈øaid, that they may as well que≈øtion all the other Scriptures as the≈øe.</p>
               <p>Now I would que≈øtion whether or no the≈øe men that thus adde to, and dimini≈øh at their plea≈øure from the word of God, be not ≈øuch as comes under that ≈øentence menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the 22. of the <hi>Revel. Cur≈øed is every one that addes or dimini≈øhes from the words which are written in this Book, and ≈øo the plagues which are written therein to be ju≈øtly due unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:35169:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And likewi≈øe that the≈øe pretended Prophets may not be the ≈øame fal≈øe deceiving Prophets which our Lord and Saviour Je≈øus Chri≈øt bids u≈øe beware, and take heed of in the 7. of <hi>Matth.</hi> ver. 15. therefore I have here in≈øerted their Tenets as followeth.</p>
